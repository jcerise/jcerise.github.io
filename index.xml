      <description>I am a software engineer. I program primarily in Python and Go, and whatever other languages strike my fancy (Go, Kotlin, Scala, Rust, Erlang, Elm, Javascript, etc). I also do other things like miniature wargaming, downhill mountain biking, and video games. Sometimes I write about these things here.

      <description>Update 8/3/2020
Gogue has come a long ways since my last update. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively full featured Go Roguelike framework. I also moved my tutorial writing over to the wiki on the Gogue project. There is a (work in progress) tutorial found here, as well as instructions on getting setup. You can also find the source for the tutorial Roguelike created in the above mentioned tutorial here.
I&amp;rsquo;m leaving this tutorial series up for posterity, but if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for more up to date information, I highly suggest you check out Gogue!</description>

Update 5/6/2018
 Obviously, I never finished this. Maybe at some point I will, but for now, its incomplete. I did however, take what I learned and created a simple Roguelike library in Go, which I call Gogue. It takes most of the concepts from my tutorials here, and puts them in an easy to use library.
 I am currently participating in r/roguelikedev&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;RoguelikeDev Does the Complete Python Tutorial&amp;rsquo;. The goal of this is to, as a group, run through the entire &amp;lsquo;Complete Roguelike Tutorial in Python&amp;rsquo;, from RogueBasin, written by Jotaf. This tutorial is a classic, in my opinion (and a few years ago, I took the opportunity to run through it myself, you can find my code on github), and is very well suited to new coders, or those who are looking to get a good overview of how a Roguelike is constructed.
For this project, I decided, since I have already run through the tutorial in Python, that I would learn a new language in the process. I chose Go, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to dive into it for a while. From there, I chose the excellent BearLibTerminal for my terminal display needs, as there is a Go package ready to use. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting my progress here, as well as a weekly blog post walking through the steps I&amp;rsquo;m taking to follow along (and any interesting Go tidbits I pick up along the way).
Part 1: Setup - code
Part 2: Movement - code
Part 3: Entities and the Map - code
Part 4: A more interesting Map - code
Part 5: Field of Vision - code
Part 6: Preparing for Combat - code
Part 7: ECS Refactor - code
[Part 8: Combat] - code
[Part 9: Basic UI] - code

Sidenotes:
Sidenote 1: Cameras - code
Sidenote 2: Vim Keys and Diagonal Movement
