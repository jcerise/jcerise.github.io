      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it begins! This is the first in a series of posts following my attempts at making a Roguelike, in Go, using BearLibTerminal. I&amp;rsquo;ll be following along with the &lt;code&gt;RoguelikeDev builds a Roguelike&lt;/code&gt; posts as I progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, lets begin week 0: Setup!`&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer. I program primarily in Python, Javascript, and whatever other languages strike my fancy (Go, Kotlin, Scala, Rust, Erlang, Elm etc). I also do other things like miniature wargaming, downhill mountain biking, and video games. Sometimes I write about these things here.

      <title>Roguelike Development</title>

      <description>I am currently participating in r/roguelikedev&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;RoguelikeDev Does the Complete Python Tutorial&amp;rsquo;. The goal of this is to, as a group, run through the entire &amp;lsquo;Complete Roguelike Tutorial in Python&amp;rsquo;, from RogueBasin, written by Jotaf. This tutorial is a classic, in my opinion (and a few years ago, I took the opportunity to run through it myself, you can find my code on github), and is very well suited to new coders, or those who are looking to get a good overview of how a Roguelike is constructed.</description>
