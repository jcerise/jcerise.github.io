      <description>Welcome to Week 2 of RoguelikeDev builds a Roguelike! This week, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be fleshing out the map that the player will be playing the game on. If you recall, last time, we created an &amp;lsquo;arena&amp;rsquo; sort of map, with a large open space in the middle, surrounded by walls along the outside edges. Not very exciting, but it was something for the player to mover around in. This week, we&amp;rsquo;re going to procedurally generate some (hopefully) realistic looking caverns that the player can explore.</description>
